# Web-Dev-Final-Project
Sigh. this is the project repository. 
We are making a project that allows users to asynchronously create events, upload CSV XLS and XLSX files that are put into the database
The user needs to be able to update each event
and we need to display all of the events (i'm trying to do this on the events.js page, but that is not working just yet
due to how I set up the API

Here's a helpful link I've been using to help set things up.
